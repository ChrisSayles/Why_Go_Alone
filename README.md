Why Go Alone ™
 
Team Members:
•	Mary Willis

Project Description:

Why Go Alone ™ will be an app designed on placing patrons together based on their interests. We as a team hope to allow both class mates, friends and strangers to align their daily interests and meet up to avoid having fun alone. 
 
We decided to use the functionality of both the google maps API and the yelp API to pin point users based on their interests and location nearest to all the users. For example, if 5 users log in that all enjoy bowling on Tuesday's the application will show the highest rated bowling alley in the central vicinity.
